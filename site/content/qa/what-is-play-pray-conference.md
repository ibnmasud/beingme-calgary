The Play & Pray Children’s Conference will consist of an innovative and extremely fun day planned for our young attendees!



 



The activities are designed so that your children can further build upon their foundation of basic Islamic principles and etiquettes, while having fun with their friends! Your little ones will explore the Qur’an through various activities designed precisely to make their wondrous imagination going.
