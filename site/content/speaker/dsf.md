title: Dr Heba
description: >
  Born and raised in Egypt. She completed medical school at Cairo University.
  While writing her thesis, she came across a passage in the Qur'an discussing
  sexual relations between husbands and wives that she saw as speaking to the
  woman's sexual rights. She says, “I was so proud of my religion when I saw
  that. My religion was advanced enough to talk about it years before modern
  science did.” 

  In 2003, she became the first licensed sexologist in Egypt, graduating with a
  degree in clinical sexology from Maimonides University. She continued her
  studies, eventually earning a Ph.D with her thesis, entitled "Sexuality in
  Islam".
