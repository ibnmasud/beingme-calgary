  No matter what your age, youth or young at heart, Open Mics are a great way to
  generate creativity and bring communities together. Come share your thoughts,
  art, poetry, spoken word or readings. Open Mics can include anything as long
  as it’s cool with the Being ME organizers.  It’s referred to as “open” because
  anyone and everyone can sign up so long as there’s time.  

  Come join our Open Mic session - Its Creative, Its Eclectic and definitely
  Thought Provoking!
