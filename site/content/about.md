WHAT IS BEING ME?
=================

Being ME, "ME" stands for Muslimah Empowered, is a conference organized by women for women, addressing the different challenges faced by women from all walks of life. From navigating the professional world, to running a successful household, and all the facets of life in between â€“ we share the knowledge of well-regarded experts in various fields.

In this, we celebrate successes and encourage every Muslim woman to seek their best self, focusing on self-development and sisterhood.

Through sharing experiences and working towards common goals, we embark upon this mission to give Muslim women an outlet to express the reality of their lifestyles, share accomplishments that benefit humanity, and to inspire one another to do the same.

WHO ARE WE?
===========

Being ME is organised by Mercy Mission, an organisation that seeks to build exemplary Islamic communities that benefits humanity. To date our portfolio of social and education projects include NISA Helpline, National Zakat Foundation, AlKauthar Institute, and New Muslim Care.

WHY WE DO IT?
=============

This conference embarks upon the mission to give all Muslim women a voice or an outlet to express the reality of their lifestyles, share accomplishments that benefit humanity and inspire others to do the same. We also provide the opportunity for all Muslim women to connect with each other so that we become pillars that support each other and the Deen.
